## Tensor Sparse Coding

* [1] F. Jiang, X.-Y. Liu, H. Lu, R. Shen. Efficient multi-dimensional tensor sparse coding using t-linear combinations. AAAI, 2018.

- The version of Python is in the folder `./2DSC`. Please run `main.py` to start.
- The version of Tensorflow has been implemented, whose codes are in the folder `./tensorflow`. Please run `train.py` to start. Then the reconstructions by tensor sparses will be saved in `./tensorflow/out/`.

## Tensor GAN
- Run `tgan` to train and generate images. We select CIFAR-10 dataset.
