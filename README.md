# Tensor-GAN

## Tensor Sparse Coding
Run main.py to get sparse representation of a 3D tensor. 

The default sample is in the folder `./samples`, which is a `101*101*31` pixel picture.

The result of default sample is as follows:

The matlab codes are in the folder `msi_denoise_matlab`.

Also, we are re-implementing sparse coding in TensorFlow
